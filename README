As recommended by Github, a README:

These are the files for a schematic version of a website built with
Foundation. I was trying out using a responsive grid, responsive
slideshow (not added yet, but already buit), mobile phone version,
media queries, web fonts, the whole shebang. 

At first I am include everything in the schematic version so as to
push this to a webserver and test in various browsers. When I am sure
the schematic works I will commit the wizzy content in the place of the 
schematic elements. So if you follow the commits you can see how a 
responsive design can be filled in. 

It is a site for a Kickstarter campaign for a kids' book, incidentally.
