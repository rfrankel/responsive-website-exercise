These are the files for a schematic version of a website built with
Foundation. I was trying out using a responsive grid, responsive
slideshow, special mobile phone friendly styles, media queries, 
web fonts, the whole shebang. 

At first I am include everything in the schematic version so as to
push this to a webserver and test in various browsers. When I am sure
the schematic works I will commit the wizzy content in the place of the 
schematic elements. So if you follow the commits you can see how a 
responsive design can be filled in. 

Update: the schematic version, which is the file randrfinal.html, which
despite its name, is not really final, has been turned into a real site, 
whose root is the file index.html (naturally enough).

It is a site for a Kickstarter campaign for a kids' book, incidentally. 
Currently, in August 2012, I am serving this version at
www.rebeccafrankel.com/randr/

For more nitty-gritty technical commentary geared toward someone who 
might want to go forward with this design, see humans.txt.
