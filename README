As recommended by Github, a README

these are the files for a schematic version of a website built with
Foundation.  I am trying to include everything so as to push this to a
webserver and test in various browsers. When I am sure the schematic
works I will add in all the wizzy content. 

It is a site for a Kickstarter campaign for a kids' book, incidentally.
