This site is built on Zurb Foundation. 
To make it work one must install Foundation also. 
It uses the Orbit Slideshow plugin and
 Foundation's responsive (fluid) grid. 
It also uses a combination of Foundations "show-on-foo" 
and "hide-on-foo" directives and vanilla media queries to change 
the site to a mobile-appropriate version when the 
screen gets narrow.

In retrospect I might not have made the mobile version 
quite so dramatically different, but perhaps because 
of differences in navigation style it is justified that way.

Updating the content of the site is not too hard. 
There are a couple of different categories of content: 

The Slides:

The slides are images, which should be all the same size, 
at 700x420 with a four pixel wide border, for a total of 708x428.
I may have screwed up when cutting them down to size so they 
aren't quite all those dimensions; I'm not sure it matters to 
get it precisely right, though one might get glitches of another
slide showing up beneath if one slide is smaller than the others. 

The reason I am talking about cutting the slides down to size is 
that they were generated by taking screenshots of html versions 
of the slides (see the manifest file, or look at the URL slide1.html,
slide2.html, etc...) The reason I did it that way was so that 
I could reasonably easily make changes to the slide, make sure 
it matched the look of the site, etc, while at the same time also 
not having to deal with all the headaches of responsive HTML slides.
I went with image slides in the final site for simplicity and robustness. 
I know it would have been cooler if the whole final page was HTML, 
but the budget was limited and I didn't want to get too precious
or get myself too tied up in knots over this small component. 

One could easily follow the template of the files slide1.html, 
slide2.html, etc. to make new slides. I think the plan is that 
the slideshow 

 The Site Content. 

The second half of the front page is a set of five themes 
of the book. There is an image, a heading, and a quote. 
This pattern of image, heading and content is echoed in 
the rest of the site as well. Almost the whole site follows
this pattern, so the css classes are fairly consistent. 
In general, the content is meant to drop out in the 
mobile version, to save space and not show a bunch of tiny 
text that nobody is going to stand squinting at their phone
to read anyway, leaving only the picture and the heading. 
The images are responsive and should resize fairly nicely
to become phone-sized, and the heading becomes a caption. 

The only exception to the rule that the content falls out 
is the "Buy" and "Contact" sections, where we might want
someone with a phone to get the directions to either Buy 
the book or Contact the site with questions or concerns. 
Now, since the Paypal page which allows one to buy the 
book is sadly not mobile-friendly, it is unlikely someone 
would actually buy from their phone, but they might like 
to be told how anyway. 

In order to keep the content from disappearing in those 
sections, there is a special class ".inneraction" which 
is different from the normal content class ".innerbody" 
The idea is that content which describes an action should 
have different rules so mobile users can see it. 

The heading for each section of content has a keyword
which is rendered in Grobold Green. The rest of the site 
(including the text in the slide images) is Futura PT from Typekit.
This font was chosen because I thought it was akin to Grobold.
Typekit's verion isn't my favorite incarnation of Futura, 
but its reasonably nice and echo's Grobolds' aesthetic. 
I generally like the combination of Grobold and Futura --- 
it is open, modern and clean, and kid-friendly without being 
too juvenile. I wish I liked Typekit's particular Futura better. 
(I think the one that showed up on my first version of the 
slide images was the incarnation of Futura installed locally 
on my computer, which I did like better.)

Menus

The one choice I made in the design which I ended up perhaps 
regretting is the shortage of menu space. At first I thought 
it would be a one-page site, with links to external blogs 
and amazon pages to buy the book, etc. So I thought there
was plenty of space, and the challenge was how to fill it. 
So I came up with these "Crystal icons", which are 
part of a huge icon set:
http://webtreats.mysitemyway.com/154-crystal-clear-bubble-social-media-icons/
that I thought to perch on the menu bar and direct the visitor 
to the external pages. I really liked that icon set because 
it is (a) huge (b) monochrome, so it can be adapted to any 
color scheme --- I turned mine green to match the edging 
(c) versatile, because directions exist online to make new ones:
http://tutorials.mysitemyway.com/crystal-clear-bubble-icons/
So I went a bit wild with the crystal icons, turning them 
into a secondary menu, and also adapting them for the slideshow
left and right buttons. 

The only problem is that I learned later that the intention 
was to have not a one-or-two page site, but a multipage site, 
with internal blog, about page, links to fun stuff and games, 
etc. etc. There might not be enough room on the menu bar to 
link to all of those things without getting rid of my beloved 
crystal icons. 

Anyway, if more room on the menu bar is really needed, one 
just has to get rid of the "secondary" menu group and allocate
more room to the "primary" group (by changing the number of 
columns alloted to each in the HTML. 

Another small note about menus: I have a tiny footer in the 
phone version that seems to link to Roger, +1 and Like pages. 
But it doesn't actually do anything, because that's just 
a suggestion. The overall design is actually notably footer-less, 
except for the auxiliary mobile phone menu. If there was really 
a need for more space for more menu items, one might want to rethink 
my design that, for the most part, ignores the footer. 

On the other hand, that may have been a result of a another choice 
of mine which results from my general attitude that requiring scrolling 
from a user is not dire, but too-small text and not enough white space 
really is. I erred on the side of wide-open space and fairly large text, 
and if that means it takes a while to get down the page, so be it. 

The Images

At the risk of violating copyright, I lifted a number of Jared's beautiful 
drawings for the site (I think its fair use, especially since I am trying 
to convince people to buy his book.) The whole aesthetic of the site is 
cartoonish, and this keeps the images thematically unified. 

I also tried to make the showcase images that go down the left side 
of the page reasonably similar in presentation --- they usually fade 
out to white along the edges in one way or another. This caused some 
difficulty in making it so that the ones which faded out radially 
would look visually aligned with the more square ones. I don't think 
I was completely succesful in this, but to the degree it worked it 
required some padding of the squarer ones with whitespace on the left 
side.
